Now I could not have done this without other Minecraft creators sharing their designs with the rest of the community.
While most of the textures are originally created by me, a lot were also inspired by others as well. These creators also showed
me how to utilize json files for various block texture changes.

I attempted to update all textures to have either a 32x or 64x resolution. Some textures just have slightly more details than
it's vanilla counterpart while some textures are completely redone, added variation and animations, etc.

The Feature List below will focus specifically on the texture changes that are significantly different from its original.
