## Installation

Place the .zip file into the resourcefolder in Minecraft. Depending on what Minecraft launcher you are using, this process may be different.

The **universal way** to get to this folder:
1. Open Minecraft
2. Click Options and go to Resource Packs
3. On the bottom, click "Open Pack Folder"

This will take you directly to where you need to save the resourcepack in order for it to work in-game.
